# GOLANG
Tracking my progress as I dive deeper into Go and Git. 
Hands-on practice, lessons learned, and building muscle memory for real-world development. 
Focusing on writing clean, idiomatic Go code and understanding Goâ€™s concurrency model. 
Every challenge is a step closer to mastering back-end development.
